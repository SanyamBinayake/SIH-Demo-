Secondary causes include the disease of other organs e.g. liver, intestines, uterus, injury of back."
G-29,‘Usr al-Bawl,عسر البول,Dysuria,"Difficulty in passing urine. It can be due to retention of viscous gases in the bladder, calculi, inflammation of bladder and secondary to diseases of adjoining organs e.g. uterus, intestine, etc."

G-6,Waram al-Mathāna,ورم المثانة,Cystitis,Inflammation of bladder is always acute in nature. Its cause is either blood/sanguine or <em>Mirra Ṣafrā’</em> (bitter yellow bile) or mixture of both.
